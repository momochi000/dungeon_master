# Dungeon Master

## Description
This is an experimental project to build an AI powered dungeon master for paper and pencil role playing.


## Development setup
The project is heavily under development and at the moment the only thing you can do is set up your development environment, repl, and call some functions.

To do this:

    docker-compose up --build
    
unfortunately, i wasn't able to connect to the repl from outside of the docker container, so currently I'm using nix. I start this with `make nix-repl`
